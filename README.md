# Experiences of Social Care in Scotland
This repo contains the functions, loops, code and markdown script used to produce a report which provides recent evidence on experiences of social care and unpaid cairing in Scotland (report here: https://www.gov.scot/publications/national-care-service-experiences-social-care-caring-scotland/documents/). The data was culled from the 2021/22 results from Health and Care Experience Survey: https://www.gov.scot/publications/health-care-experience-survey-2021-22-national-results/ 

This evidence paper is part of a suite of outputs setting out key sources of information about social care and related areas in Scotland. These were produced to inform the development of Scotland's National Care Service, which can be found here: https://www.gov.scot/collections/national-care-service/.

Note that the underlying data contains sensitive, individual-level data. This repo therefore does not contain the script used to import, tidy or merge the data itself. It only contains the code to produce the results.
